# SocialSpace

SocialSpace is a Next.js app that lets users scroll through dummy posts fetched from [dummyjson API](https://dummyjson.com/). The homepage lets the user see 10 posts. The user can see a post's comments by clicking 'see post'. By clicking on a post's tag, users can see all the posts with that tag. Users can also see all the tags and search posts by tags by navigating to the Posts section of the app.

I also want to add a feature to search posts by keywords

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The application is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). See live project [here](https://social-space-nine.vercel.app/).
