# SocialSpace

SocialSpace is a Next.js app that lets users scroll through dummy posts fetched from [dummyjson API](https://dummyjson.com/). The homepage lets the user see 10 posts. The user can see a post's comments by clicking 'see post'. By clicking on a post's tag, users can see all the posts with that tag. Users can also see all the tags and search posts by tags by navigating to the 'Search' section of the app. Users can also search posts by keywords.

Users can like and add comments to posts. These can be seen inside the user's profile. Users can also add posts and see them on their profiles.

Added posts and comments are not added to any database but stored inside localStorage.

> [!NOTE]
> Nav bar buttons are currently removed. They will be replaced by other buttons later on.

## What needs to be added

- Searching by user-created tags
- Adding buttons to the navbar
